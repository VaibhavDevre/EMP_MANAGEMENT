    An "About Us" Page is where you reveal your brand story, business values, mission, and experiences.  
    <br>
    <hr>

Now the question is: why would you want to share all this information and make it appealing? The answer
<br>
<hr>

is simple: you want to tell your audience who you are, show them what you are good at, and tell them you are

worthy of their trust.
<br>
<hr>

Think for a moment: would you rather purchase from a business you know nothing about, or would you go for 
<br>
<hr>

somebody with a friendly face shared on their About page and a story that you find exciting? The latter one, right? 
<br>
<hr>

A great About Us page not just portrays your story, qualities and provides an insight on how your business started, 
<br>
<hr>

but it also helps you sell. When visitors become familiar with your story and connect with it, they are probably going 
<br>
<hr>

to purchase from you. A well-planned About Us page can do this!
